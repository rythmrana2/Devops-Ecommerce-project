## About The Project
This project consists of HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, PHP and MYSQLI code.The project is structured as follows:
1) HTML , CSS AND BOOTSTRAP: used to design the look of each page of the website.
2) PHP & MySQLi: used to add functionality to the website. This will allow users to register and buy products on the website.
3) Advanced PHP: used to add advanced features, such as validations and security to the website.

## Structure Of The Project
The six main pages designed in the project are:
1. index.php
The index page will be the landing page of the website i.e. the page which a user will first see when he/she opens
the website

2. about.php
Contains information about the website.

3. contact.php
Contains contact details.

4. signup.php
On the signup page, new users can register using the ‘signup’ form and create accounts, while existing users can login using the ‘login’ modal. As you can see, the signup form has six fields i.e. ‘name’, ‘email’, ‘password’, ‘contact’, ‘address’ and ‘city’. What you cannot see is the backend or the functionality of the form, which comprises of form validation and form injection.

5. success.php
The success page informs the user that his/her order has been accepted and his items would be delivered shortly. Also, there is a link to the home page where the user can purchase more items.

6. settings.php
This page will contain only one row. The row will consist of one column containing a form. Here, we again implement form validation. If the user enters different passwords in the fields ‘New Password’ and ‘Retype New Password’, a message is shown that the passwords don’t match. If the user enters the incorrect ‘Old
Password’, an error message is displayed indicating that he/she has entered the wrong password. If the user fills the three fields correctly, his/her password is updated. The form uses form injection to reduce security threats.
